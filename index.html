<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is the third installment to the Counter-Strike franchise.  It began back in 1999 when the game was released as a modification to the orignal game called Half-Life.  Seeing how successful the game was it went through many updates which improved the game from CS 1.1 all the way till 1.6.  At this point the game began to gain popularity in the online scene, and scheduled lan events were beginning to show up across the globe.
	</p>
<p>	
	In 2004 Counter-Strike released there new game called Counter-Strike Source. It was the same mechanics as there old game but just retouched with better graphics and some improved playability.  As the game rose to the top of the PC gaming world as the best first person shooter (FPS) game the popularity for events began to grow and rise.</p>
<p>
	With the release of CS:GO in 2012 the game had once again been touched up visually and improved for optimal performance capabilities.  At this point by 2014 there began to have Major events around the world mostly in Europe that were considerd to the CS:GO Majors.  These events would pay $250,000 for first prize and would start to sell out arenas for spectators to watch.</p>
<p>
	The Counter-Strike franchise has become the only FPS game that now released by Valve (the company that distributes that game) to have a 1,000,000.00 dollar pot prize for all Major CS:GO tournaments in 2016</p>
